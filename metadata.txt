name=Processing BEAM and SNAP algorithm Provider
description= QGIS Processing provider for GPF-based algorithms (BEAM and SNAP). 

about= 
	QGIS Processing provider for GPF (Graph Processing Framework)-based algorithms. Currently supports selected algorithms from BEAM 5.0 (http://www.brockmann-consult.de/cms/web/beam/) and SNAP 5.0  (http://step.esa.int).
	
	The plugin requires BEAM 5.0 and/or SNAP 5.0 to be installed for it to be able to access their GPF algorithms. See README in code repository for further instructions.
	
	This plugin is part of the Water Observation Information System (WOIS) developed under the TIGER-NET project funded by the European Space Agency as part of the long-term TIGER initiative aiming at promoting the use of Earth Observation (EO) for improved Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in Africa.
